#Gameshop
##This project was developed as a follow up project to the stuff I've learned in the Internet Software Architecture course.

## Main idea behind the project is a e-commerce shop that is selling digital video-game copies online video the actual payment implementation.

### Technologies that I've used / planning to use for this project are the following:
    #### 1) Java - Spring Boot BE built as a REST API
    #### 2) React - SPA application using react router
    #### 3) Relational database - MySQL
